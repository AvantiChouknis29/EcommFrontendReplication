# EcommFrontendReplication
As a web developer looking to enhance my skills, I took on the challenge of replicating the Dot and Key website. This project served as a practical exercise to test and refine my HTML and CSS abilities. I closely analyzed the original website's design, layout, and visual elements to recreate them as closely as possible.
## Features

- **HTML Structure**: The project includes a well-structured HTML layout, utilizing semantic tags for optimal organization.

- **CSS Styling**: Careful attention has been paid to CSS styling, including fonts, colors, spacing, and responsiveness, aiming for a pixel-perfect match with the original website.

- **Layout and Responsiveness**: The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

- **Images and Media**: High-quality images and media assets have been included, optimized for fast loading.
